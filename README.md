## Hello :wave: I am Jonas - a software developer with a background in teaching  

I love building software - it feels amazing to create something new that really works and that people can use. Previously I spent 8 Years of fostering an excitement for learning in children - getting better at something is simply beautiful. :hibiscus:

Whilst working at my last school, I rediscovered my passion for coding and spent the last year retraining. I just graduated from Makersâ€˜ 4 months immersive coding bootcamp and am keen to start working.

I really enjoy problem solving and working in the tech industry would mean I get a chance to do this all day long!
