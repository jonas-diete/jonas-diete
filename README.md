## Hello :wave: I am Jonas - a software developer with a background in teaching  

I love building software - it feels amazing to create something new that really works and that people can use. Previously I spent 8 Years of fostering an excitement for learning in children - getting better at something is simply beautiful. :hibiscus:

Whilst working at my last school, I rediscovered my passion for coding and spent the last year retraining. I graduated from Makersâ€˜ 4 months immersive coding bootcamp last year and am currently working as a Software Test Engineer for Lotus Cars. ðŸš—

I really enjoy problem solving and in Software Development I get to do this all day long which is awesome!

### :rocket: Current Mission  
Implement a highscore / world record list for my [times table learning app](https://github.com/jonas-diete/timestablecoach).
